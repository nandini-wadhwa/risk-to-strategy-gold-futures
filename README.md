# risk-to-strategy-gold-futures
A two-phase quantitative research project that evolves from econometric risk modelling of Gold Futures (ARIMA, GARCH, VaR/ES) into a regime-aware algorithmic trading system with adaptive strategies and backtesting. Demonstrates the complete workflow from risk analysis → volatility regimes → strategy design → performance evaluation.
